The FIM 2010 Granfeldt Workflow Activity Library is a collection of generic custom workflows for use with FIM 2010 R1/R2. The purpose of this collection of workflow activities is to have activities that can solve the most common tasks in a traditional FIM installation - in one library.

For more information on installing and configuring the individual activities, refer to the Wiki.

If you have an idea for a generic activity, I would like to hear from you.

_Enjoy,_
